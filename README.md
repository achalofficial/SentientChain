# SentientChain

## Overview
**SentientChain** is an advanced decentralized AI project that integrates blockchain technology with large language models (LLMs) to create a distributed, self-improving AI ecosystem. The project aims to harness blockchain for transparency, security, and scalable AI model training, inference, and governance.

## Vision
The goal of SentientChain is to build a system that is:
- **Decentralized:** No single point of failure or control.
- **Transparent:** All model updates and transactions are verifiable on the blockchain.
- **Self-improving:** AI models evolve continuously through decentralized contributions.
- **Secure:** Robust data provenance and tokenized incentives ensure trustless operations.

## Project Components

### 1. Blockchain Layer
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Proof-of-Compute (PoC) to reward actual AI work.
- **Smart Contracts:** Manage AI governance, model updates, and token economics.
- **Tokenomics:** A native token incentivizes contributions from compute nodes.
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS/Filecoin or similar for storing model checkpoints and logs.

### 2. AI Layer (LLM)
- **Model Base:** Starting with an open-source model (e.g., Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) that is fine-tuned for our needs.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Decentralized training on domain-specific data.
- **Inference:** Executing AI queries with results verifiable on-chain.

### 3. Compute Layer
- **Decentralized Nodes:** Distributed compute resources (e.g., GPUs) contribute to AI training and inference.
- **Verification:** AI outputs are checked using on-chain proofs and, potentially, zero-knowledge techniques.

### 4. Integration & API
- **Smart Contract Integration:** Seamlessly link AI model training and inference with blockchain operations.
- **APIs:** Allow external applications to interact with the decentralized AI network.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research & Setup (Completed)
- Define project vision and architecture.
- Set up the GitHub repository with initial scripts.
- Download and test the base LLM using `scripts/download_models.py`.

### Phase 2: Model Integration & Blockchain Setup
- Integrate the LLM with the blockchain infrastructure.
- Develop basic smart contracts for AI governance.
- Test decentralized AI inference and training.

### Phase 3: Decentralized Compute & Tokenomics
- Deploy a network of compute nodes to share AI workloads.
- Implement token-based incentives for contributions.
- Enable community-driven AI model updates through a DAO.

### Phase 4: Scaling & Optimization
- Optimize model performance and training efficiency.
- Expand to multi-chain interoperability.
- Enhance security and governance mechanisms.
